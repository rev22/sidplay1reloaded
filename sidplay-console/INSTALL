CONFIGURATION:

By default, this directory is set up for an i386-compatible Linux system
with an OSS/Free audio driver. Simply run ``make'' to compile.


OTHER PLATFORMS:

Activate an appropriate audio driver by copying it from the subdirectory
``audio/''. Then run ``make''. For example:

# cp audio/sparc_audiodrv.h audiodrv.h
# cp audio/sparc_audiodrv.cpp audiodrv.cpp
# make
