sidplay (1.36.15-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (pristine 1.36.13, with patches).
  * Compiled with egcs (pre 1.0.2), which solved several problems that
    gcc had (-O2 and -g, -fPIC and certain tunes).
  * Explicitly linked with -lc.
  * The package called ldconfig in postrm only if not upgrading,
    but I removed this anyway to satisfy lintian.
  * Includes now the documentation from the SidPlay homepage for
    offline reading.

sidplay (1.36.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Don't use control file "du" anymore.
  * Made /usr/doc/sidplay a symlink to /usr/doc/libsidplay1 (Fixes:#18648).
  * Rewrote the detailed descriptions in debian/control in order to reflect
    the changed "main" package.
  * Lintian (0.2.4) approved.

sidplay (1.36.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Failing to play certain SID tunes was caused by '-O2' AND '-fPIC',
    however using '-O1' together with '-fPIC' seems to work fine.

sidplay (1.36.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * debian/rules rewritten, use debhelper instead of several
    'install's and 'cp's.
  * Changed "main" package from sidplay (kind of sample application)
    to libsidplay1, yielding simpler dh_* calls.
  * "Downgraded" policy conformance to 2.3.0.0 :(, in order to match debhelper.
  * Suggests xsidplay now.

sidplay (1.36.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Added maintainer scripts (postinst, postrm), that merely call
    ldconfig. This wouldn't be necessary according to the current
    policy, but was recommended on the debian-mentors mailing list.
  * Moved *.so link from the shared library package to the dev package.

sidplay (1.36.3-1) unstable; urgency=low
