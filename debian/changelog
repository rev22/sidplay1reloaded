sidplay (1.36.25-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Calls ./configure in debian/rules, because it doesn't take long to
    execute and it may help building the package for other architectures
    and other compiler environments (eg. gcc instead of egcc) (Fixes:#23931).

sidplay (1.36.15-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non maintainer alpha only release
  * now depends on libstdc++-dev requested by 
    Ray jdassen@wi.leidenuniv.nl

 -- Christian Meder <meder@isr.uni-stuttgart.de>  Wed, 15 Apr 1998 13:02:01 +0200

sidplay (1.36.15-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (pristine 1.36.13, with patches).
  * Compiled with egcs (pre 1.0.2), which solved several problems that
    gcc had (-O2 and -g, -fPIC and certain tunes).
  * Explicitly linked with -lc.
  * The package called ldconfig in postrm only if not upgrading,
    but I removed this anyway to satisfy lintian.
  * Includes now the documentation from the SidPlay homepage for
    offline reading.

    the changed "main" package.

sidplay (1.36.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Failing to play certain SID tunes was caused by '-O2' AND '-fPIC',
    however using '-O1' together with '-fPIC' seems to work fine.

 -- Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>  Sat, 31 Jan 1998 19:55:27 +0100

sidplay (1.36.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * debian/rules rewritten, use debhelper instead of several
    'install's and 'cp's.
  * Changed "main" package from sidplay (kind of sample application)
    to libsidplay1, yielding simpler dh_* calls.
  * "Downgraded" policy conformance to 2.3.0.0 :(, in order to match debhelper.
  * Suggests xsidplay now.

 -- Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Jan 1998 21:22:29 +0100

sidplay (1.36.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Added maintainer scripts (postinst, postrm), that merely call
    ldconfig. This wouldn't be necessary according to the current
    policy, but was recommended on the debian-mentors mailing list.
  * Moved *.so link from the shared library package to the dev package.

 -- Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jan 1998 22:29:28 +0100
