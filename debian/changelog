sidplay (1.36.25-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>  Sun,  2 Aug 1998 12:58:16 +0200

 -- Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Apr 1998 18:11:37 +0200

 -- Christian Meder <meder@isr.uni-stuttgart.de>  Wed, 15 Apr 1998 13:02:01 +0200

sidplay (1.36.15-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (pristine 1.36.13, with patches).

    gcc had (-O2 and -g, -fPIC and certain tunes).

    but I removed this anyway to satisfy lintian.

    offline reading.

 -- Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Mar 1998 20:27:22 +0200

 -- Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Mar 1998 23:30:00 +0100

sidplay (1.36.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Failing to play certain SID tunes was caused by '-O2' AND '-fPIC',
    however using '-O1' together with '-fPIC' seems to work fine.

 -- Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>  Sat, 31 Jan 1998 19:55:27 +0100

  * debian/rules rewritten, use debhelper instead of several
    'install's and 'cp's.

    to libsidplay1, yielding simpler dh_* calls.
  * "Downgraded" policy conformance to 2.3.0.0 :(, in order to match debhelper.
  * Suggests xsidplay now.

 -- Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Jan 1998 21:22:29 +0100

sidplay (1.36.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Added maintainer scripts (postinst, postrm), that merely call
    ldconfig. This wouldn't be necessary according to the current
    policy, but was recommended on the debian-mentors mailing list.
  * Moved *.so link from the shared library package to the dev package.

 -- Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jan 1998 22:29:28 +0100
