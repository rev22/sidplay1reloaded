This package was debianised, prepackaged and is currently maintained
by me, Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>, from the sources that
I obtained from the SidPlay HomePage at
 http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/

No changes, besides adding support for the Debian package maintenance
scheme by creating various debian/* files, were necessary.
