    <u><a name="intro"><h1>Introduction</h1></a></u>
    <p align=justify>
	  Basically, SIDPLAY <a href="#footnodeName">[1]</a> is just an ordinary music player software.
      More specifically, SIDPLAY emulates the <a href="http://stud1.tuwien.ac.at/~e9426444/index.html"><strong>Sound Interface Device</strong></a> chip (MOS 6581, commonly called <strong>SID</strong>)
	  and the Micro Processor Unit (MOS 6510) of the Commodore 64 <a href="#footnodeC64">[2]</a> on your computer. It is a
	  platform independent software which emulates these hardware components. Therefore it is able
	  to load and execute C64 machine code programs which produce music or sound. In general
	  these are independent fragments of code and data which have been <a href="info.html#ripping">ripped</a> from games and
	  demonstration programs and have been transferred directly from the C64.
	</p>
	
    <p align=justify>
	  All you need is a supported operating system and audio hardware with average PCM
	  waveform playback capabilities. A fast CPU and a 16-bit sound card are recommended
	  for better performance and slightly better audio quality.
	</p>
  
    <p align=justify>
	  SID emulation has its roots in the AMIGA programs <strong>The 100 most remembered C64
	  game-tunes</strong> (1990) and <strong>PlaySID</strong> (1990-1994) by Per H&#229;kan Sundell and Ron Birk.
	  After PlaySID v2.2, SIDPLAY was the second publicly available SID music player
	  world-wide and the first one on several operating systems. Other SID emulators
	  have been developed, but are not covered by these pages in detail.
	</p>
  
    <p align=justify>
	  SIDPLAY is <em>not</em> based on any portions of sourcecode from PlaySID.
	  It has been developed and programmed from scratch. As a result and also influenced
	  by the different hardware that has been used during development, its SID emulator
	  architecture differs significantly from PlaySID.
	</p>
  
    <p align=justify>
	  SIDPLAY is <em>not</em> related to the music editing and playing programs on the C64, called
	  <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~craigch/sidplayer/"><em>Sidplayer</em> by Craig Chamberlain</a> and <em>Stereo Sidplayer</em> by Mark A.Dickenson. In
	  the early days of the SIDPLAY project I was not aware of the existence of those C64 programs.
	  I didn't want to start any confusion by choosing a similar name.
	  Nevertheless, minor support for Sidplayer .MUS files is implemented, too.
	</p>
  
    <p align=justify>
	  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/sidplay/credits.html">Various authors</a> have made available ports of
      SIDPLAY on the most popular operating systems. Please respect
	  the individual licences and wishes of each author, and carefully read
	  version-specific release notes.
	  If you would like to port <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/sidplay/download.html#linux">the freely available emulator
	  engine</a>, which is written in C++, to any available hardware platform or
	  operating system, feel free to do so. It would be nice if you would
      contact me to tell me about your plans. However, I don't mind if you put
      out any work silently. You are welcome to help with development of any kind,
	  whether it be player front ends, tools, audio enhancements, or emulation improvement.

    <H2><a name="sidtune">The term ``sidtune''</a></H2>
    
    <p align=justify>
      Apparently, the European part of the world refers to any piece of Commodore 64 music - where
      the SID chip is used to produce sound - as <b>sidtune</b>, while some of the American part
      of the world only denote music, which is made with the C64 programs <em>Sidplayer</em>
      or <em>Stereo Sidplayer</em>, sidtunes or just <b>sids</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p align=justify>
      In any SIDPLAY related document the term sidtune applies to any kind of SID music. This should be an
      obvious decision, considering that hardly any music from well-known C64 games and demos was made
      with either the two applications mentioned above, but each song is commonly called a sidtune.
      Especially it is not distinguished between ready-to-play files and music player machine code
      (and data) in a C64 program.
    </p>
    
    <p align=justify>
      For instance, you can hear someone saying ``I'm listening to the Commando sidtune'' instead of
      something like ``I'm listening to Rob Hubbard's music from Commando''.
      And another one writes ``I will mail you the new sidtunes I've managed to rip from games and demos''.
    </p>


    <H2><a name="sidtunes">Sidtunes for SIDPLAY and compatibles</a></H2>

    <p align=justify>
      More than 10000 different sidtunes from Commodore 64 games and demos are available on the Internet.
      A lot even contain several sub-songs. These musics are still copyrighted by their original creators
      or by the company who owns the rights in the first release.
    </p>
    
    <p align=justify>
      As of 1996 a lot of the sidtunes are 10 years old. Some are even older, some are not a month old.
      Hence, spreading them together with the original credits is more likely to act as advertising than
      causing any consequential damage. Additionally, the maintainers of recent sidtune collections
      are in contact with a lot of (famous) C64 music composers and get invaluable support upon
      verifying the song credits and ownerships.
    </p>
    
    <p align=justify>
	  Usually SIDPLAY is not distributed together with any SID music files. You
	  need to download additional packages elsewhere if you are new to SID music.
	  The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/sidplay/links.html">links</a> section is a good starting-point.
	  My own favourite sidtunes are listed <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/sidplay/topsids.html">here</a>.
	  There is no better SID music collection available than the
	  <a href="http://www.dhp.com/~shark/c64music/hv_sids">High Voltage SID
	  Collection</a>. Rather than purchasing expensive CD-ROMs which do often
	  contain nothing else than MegaBytes of crap (for instance, lots of unsorted
	  and outdated sidtune packages from the Internet, each one containing lots of
	  repeats) spend some time on checking out the HVSC. You'll like it. Here are the
	  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/9487/hvscmain.htm">HVSC News</a> pages.

  <u><h1>The truth about SID <strike>emulation</strike>... approximation</h1></u>
  <p align=justify>
  Unlike some available C64 emulators, SIDPLAY does not claim it would emulate
  the original SID chip perfectly, neither the MOS-6581 revisions nor the
  later MOS-8580 revisions.
  Consider the audio output to be just an approximation of the sound of a
  real SID chip.
  Better do not replay at frequencies much higher than 48 kHz. Although it
  may work for your particular soundcard, the emulator is not made for higher
  frequencies. It has not been tested whether certain emulation features
  work satisfactory for higher playback frequencies.
  <a href="#techinfo">Here</a> is a short list of what is
  implemented in SIDPLAY. The overall emulation accuracy is considered to be around <strong>75%</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <table border=0 cellspacing=10 align=center>
  
  <tr>
  <td>
  <p align=justify>
  The analogue output of the SID hardware is extremely complex and partially irregular.
  This makes it almost impossible for an emulator author to develop software that calculates
  equivalent output. Additionally, the output of each individual SID chip
  varies not just slightly due to tolerances in its electronical components, such as capacitors
  for instance. To give you an impression of the extent of a possible difference between two
  SID chips, it is possible that you are hardly able to notice a low-pass filter
  effect on one chip whereas the same filter effect sounds way too strong on
  another chip.
  </p>

  <tr>
  <td>
  <p align=justify>
  If you think the emulation is better, you most likely are used to it and
  don't remember the sound of a real SID chip. Be assured that not even all
  of the old tunes (1983-1991) sound fully correct. Certain features could
  be added to the emulator at any time, but would not necessarily increase
  the accuracy of emulation. For instance, adding a cycle-accurate 6510
  emulator to SIDPLAY would require to redesign its SID emulator. For some
  sidtunes this could even lead to a lower emulation quality.
  </p>

  <h3>The wrong way</h3>
  <p align=justify>
  On <a href="news:comp.emulators.cbm">Usenet</a> you can meet C64-emulator
  users who are certain that Adlib/OPL2/OPL3-based SID emulation is better
  due to its smoother sound. This is ridiculous. Those people are labouring under
  a misapprehension. Once and for all, the Adlib/OPL FM-chips cannot be used
  to produce SID-like sounds, effects and filters. They are too different.
  </p>
  
  <p align=justify>
  In the same newsgroup it has been said that SID emulators would do
  end-level filtering like some MOD players do. This is nonsense. SID filtering
  is applied to each individual voice separately after volume
  modulation, of course.
  </p>

</td>

<tr>
<td>
  <h3>Impossible mission?</h3>
  <p align=justify>
  Now, what would be necessary to reach an emulation accuracy of 100%? Or to
  re-phrase the question, where are the differences between a real and an
  emulated SID chip?
  </p>

  <p align=justify>
  Sampling - i.e. digitizing - the entire variety of sounds a SID chip can
  produce is not possible either. Hence the most common approach is to
  examine the SID's waveforms and envelope data via its readable voice/operator
  three and try to calculate similar data. This method seems to work fine for the
  reproduction of normal waveforms, synchronization, ring modulation, and a
  rough ADSR-envelope. Like the SID, filtering and volume modulation needs to
  be applied on top of the waveform data. But the SID's final audio output
  still differs due to D/A conversion, output amplification, side-effects and
  additional undocumented behaviour under certain circumstances. The combined
  waveforms vary with frequency and time and thus need a new emulation
  approach. Frequency-shifting a recorded combined waveform is not
  satisfactory. In case of very fast chip access as it is performed in
  multi-speed music players, the SID chip can show an unexpected behaviour.
  But even during normal operation a SID chip's behaviour does not always
  match the existing specification. What is the SID chip's correct and
  accurate behaviour?
  </p>
  
  <p align=justify>
  Since exact timing and detailed reproduction of the hardware's state is
  desired, a perfect SID music player would have to emulate the SID chip on
  the level of electronic engineering and would have to include cycle-accurate
  emulation of the complete C64 hardware and software. If that is not possible,
  the SID emulator engine would have to be cycle-accurate as well. It would
  have to be capable of changing internal state quickly, but still accurately.
  Considering exceptions, side-effects, and hardware limits, what is the SID
  chip's correct and accurate behaviour in all cases?

  <p>
  If you find a sidtune which does not play, you might have encountered 
  <ul>
  <li> a socalled <em>PlaySID-specific</em> rip
  <li> a bad rip, that means the sidtune most likely does not run on a C64 either
  <li> a sidtune which is set up improperly and has never been verified
  <li> a rip that requires features that are not emulated
  <li> a file that just doesn't work at all (yes, this has happened before)
  <li> a bug in the emulator environment
  </UL>
  In either case try to run the song by enabling the <b>Transparent ROM</b> mode first.
  If it still does not run, try enabling the <b>PlaySID environment</b> mode.
  If it still does not run, make sure 
  <ul>
  <li> the sidtune is in a known and supported file format and is not rejected by the emulator
  <li> you can get other sidtunes to work
  <li> you have really tried the <b>PlaySID environment</b> mode
  <li> you have the latest update to your favourite sidtune collection
  <li> the sidtune collection is made for SIDPLAY or a fully compatible SID emulator
  <li> you have the latest version of SIDPLAY if available
  </UL>
  </p>

  <h1><a name="bugreport">How to submit a bug report?</a></h1>
  <p>
  If you happen to encounter a bug or anything unexpected, contact the author(s).
  It is very unlikely that the maintainer of a sidtune collection releases non-working tunes. So if
  you definitely can't get a song to work, try asking the individual maintainer of that collection
  for verification first. But don't forget to provide at least this information
  <ul>
  <li> the full song name and author of the sidtune
  <li> the number of the sub-song that doesn't play
  <li> the complete file name and path, under no circumstances just a short MS-DOS file name
  <li> the version of the sidtune collection you have taken the sidtune from
  </UL>
  as well as at least the following, which you are supposed to provide when contacting
  the author(s) of SIDPLAY:
  <ul>

  The latest and best maintained sidtune collection on the Internet is the
  <a href=http://www.dhp.com/~shark/c64music/hv_sids><b>High Voltage SID
  Collection</b></a>. Related information is located at the same site.
  You can choose between download of individual sidtunes, automated updates
  to the collection and always the latest complete collection. Additionally
  you can use a <a href="http://www.c64.org/sidfind">search engine</a> to look up individual sids.

  <h1><a name="asmsource">Where can I find the ASM source code of SIDPLAY?</a></h1>
  <p>
    You can't. Only the DOS version was written in ASM. 
    The old assembler language sourcecode is available, but will not
    be published. Anyone with serious interest in creating a new SID player
    for MS-DOS could port back the 32-bit emulator engine.
  </p>
  
  <h1><a name="demos">Can you help me playing SID music in my demo?</a></h1>
  <p>
  Although the SIDPLAY emulator engine is not designed and optimized for
  usage in demos, intros and similar, it is possible to use its platform
  independent code. A 32-bit C++ compiler, soundcard drivers, and maybe
  a few portability adjustments are needed.

  Check the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/sidplay/links.html">links section</a> on the SIDPLAY home page. There is at least one
  emulator related home page linked that explains how to process C64 files
  and where to get the necessary software and hardware.

  <h1><a name="convert">How to convert the sidtune file formats?</a></h1>
  <p>
  Notice, you <b>don't</b> need to. In case of sidtunes that consist of more
  than one file, any format conversion is optional. As modern SID music collections
  come in one-file format only, this question might as well be removed from
  this FAQ.
  </p>
  <p>
  On the contrary, there are still old sidtune packages on the Internet. Such
  packages may contain files in any of the supported multiple-file formats.
  The file naming might be very unusual. And as there is no way to detect plain C64 data
  files, an unknown file might as well contain text or graphics, but just no music data.
  </p>
  <p>
  By default, but depending on the particular player front end, SIDPLAY searches
  your directory for the following possible file name extensions and tries to
  match a pair of files if the specified file is not in one-file format. This
  list may change at any time:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li> none
  <li> <TT>*.sid</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.dat</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.inf</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.DAT</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.SID</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.INF</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.c64</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.prg</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.C64</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.PRG</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.info</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.INFO</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.data</TT>
  <li> <TT>*.DATA</TT>
  </UL>
  <p>
  You have the possibility to configure other default file extensions. In case of two-file sidtunes
  you only need to provide file names which contain any of the extensions supported by
  the particular version of SIDPLAY you are using. It is recommended that you get accustomed to
  the <b><TT>*.sid</b></TT> extension for one-file sidtunes.
  </p>
  <p>
  Experienced users of SIDPLAY may want to do optional conversion when working on sidtunes.
  For instance, if you would like to change the song info or modify the ripped data. This may
  either be done from inside the player front end or with external utilities.
  </p>

  <h1><a name="extract">How to extract old collections for PlaySID?</a></h1>
  <p>
  <b>Q</b>: When I downloaded the song archives, I found out that I can't extract the <b><TT>.INF</b></TT>
  files from the <b><TT>.LHA</b></TT> files. Apparently, when I use DOS to extract them, LHA can't handle the
  fact that the files have a four character extension <b><TT>.INFO</b></TT>.  How can I get the info files out
  of the LHA files?
  <p>
  <b>A</b>: Use <TT>LHA x -a -m2</TT> to extract the files from the LHA archives. When the extraction is
  complete you don't need to convert any files for use with SIDPLAY. But before proceeding, make sure
  what types of files the archive contained. This is necessary to successfully complete the following
  probably required renaming procedure:
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> If there exist files <TT>*.inf</TT> (long name inside archive is <TT>*.info</TT>), there are
  also corresponding files <TT>*</TT> without extension. Rename the files <TT>*</TT> to
  <b><TT>*.dat</b></TT> or your preferred custom sidtune data file extension! Now SIDPLAY will list those
  files and will automatically make use of the additional <TT>*.inf</TT> files.
  <li> If there don't exist files <TT>*.inf</TT> (long name inside archive is not <TT>*.info</TT>), you
  can either rename all files to a file extension that is supported by your version of SIDPLAY or
  proceed like described <a href="#nemesids">in this FAQ</a>.
  </UL>
  <p>

  <h1><a name="nemesids">How to extract the NemeSIDs Collection?</a></h1>
  <p>
  With MS-DOS always use <TT>LHA x -a -m2</TT> to extract the files from the LHA archives. While option
  <TT>-a</TT> allows files with any attributes to be extracted, option <TT>-m2</TT> enables renaming of
  double filenames. Double filenames are caused by LHA cutting long filenames from the AmigaDOS
  file-system to the limited length of the (MS-)DOS file-system.
  </p>
  <p>
  When the extraction is complete you find a lot of files named <b><TT>psid.*</b></TT> in each directory.
  In some newer packages the filename is simply the name of the tune. Caution. A few files are
  <em>read only</em> or even <em>hidden</em>. You will have to manually change their file attribute to
  be able to see them. The main job will be to rename the files, so that SIDPLAY is able to find
  and list them. Adding a support file extension to each file should usually be enough.
  </p>
  <p>
  For some operating systems there are small helper utilities which are capable of renaming
  sidtune files automatically. 4DOS users may like to make use of the <b>Psid EXtracting utility</b>.
  The script and its documentation are available on most C64 emulation FTP servers.
  </p>
  <p>
  You are advised to upgrade to a more recent sidtune collection.

  <h1><a name="editors">How to make SID music?</a></h1>
  <p>
  Get a SID music editor at <a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/cbm/c64/audio/editors/">Funet</a>
  or any other C64-related FTP site. You are strongly advised to compose your
  music on a real C64 to ensure that it does not depend on accuracy of 
  SID emulation. Alternatively, you can use any available C64 emulator with
  satisfactory SID emulation, for instance <a href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~fachat/vice/vice.html">VICE</a>.

  <U><h1><a name="playsidcompatibility">PlaySID compatibility issues</a></h1></U>
  
  <p>
    If you use SIDPLAY together with old music collections which have been
    made especially for PlaySID on AMIGA, you are likely to find
    troublemakers among the sidtunes. You are advised to stop using such old
    collections. They often contain lots of wrong credits and duplicates.
  </p>
  
  <H2><a name="bankswitching">Lack of bank switching</a></H2>
  <p>
    If some tunes stay silent or sound strange in an undescribable manner,
    try toggling the <b>PlaySID environment</b> mode. It is a similar memory
    environment like PlaySID uses. It may sometimes be referred to as
    <em>PlaySID compatibility mode</em>. It is just provided to ensure compatibility
    even in the worst case. This mode is disabled by
    default, since it does not provide as flexible emulation as the native SIDPLAY
    mode does. It is <em>not</em> recommended to enable it by default unless you really
    encounter some PlaySID-specific sidtunes and you know what you are doing.
    In modern sidtune collections you usually don't need to disable any sort of
    bank-switching.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note, that PlaySID's one-file format <b><TT>PSID</b></TT> is still the most common
    format used by sidtune collections. The musics in PSID format might have been
    converted from SIDPLAY's ASCII info file format without any loss of
    data. But the playback may cause problems due to a difference in PlaySID's and
    SIDPLAY's emulation and way of handling and initializing the music data.
  </p>
  <p>
    PlaySID pretends plain 64 kB of C64 random-access-memory to get rid of 
    C64-bank-switching but does not allow the safe usage of the memory range <em>under</em>
    the SID address space. Some sidtunes use this memory for large data, e.g. 
    samples in Chris H&#252;lsbeck's ``Chip War'', and they sound damaged in PlaySID.
    The C64 uses bank-switching to map parts of the ROM and I/O address space 
    into the limited physical address space of 64 kB. When SIDPLAY was developed
    from scratch, without any knowledge of PlaySID's inner workings, I decided to 
    emulate partial bank-switching as well (although the current implementation level of
    SIDPLAY does not provide full support for code execution in ROM). The benefit
    of this decision is the ability
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to replay sidtunes that use any part of the C64 memory,<br>
        especially under the I/O area and under the SID chip
    <li>to successfully distinguish between RAM and ROM access
    <li>to intercept code branches into ROM
  </UL>
  <p>
    Attracted (or misguided?) by the plain C64 memory of PlaySID, rippers of 
    hundreds of sidtunes totally neglected bank-switching in the changes they did
    to the music players. Luckily, there are only a few tunes where bank-switching
    would be required to successfully run them on a real C64 or SIDPLAY. 
    Concerning the latter, the tunes just stay silent or in the worst case drop
    some notes or voices. For instance, Fred Gray's ``Army Moves'', ``Madballs'',
    ``Troll'' or Martin Galway's ``Mikie'' had been PlaySID-specific,
    but have been fixed to work
    correctly. As long as there are still PlaySID-specific sidtunes floating around
    in various packages on the network, you might have to temporarily enable the
    <em>PlaySID environment</em> mode to get a particular tune to work.
  </p>
  
  <H2><a name="SECTION00420000000000000000">Emulator dependent code</a></H2>
  <p>
    There is another minor problem with PlaySID-specific sidtunes that can cause
    sidtunes to stay silent or malfunction. We discovered
    some sidtunes that assume the processors' registers to contain a constant value
    (zero) upon initialization.
    Those tunes don't run on a real C64 (where the processors' registers contain
    the last active value, which is unlikely to be zero). Inspite of this,
    SIDPLAY provides the song number in all three processor registers upon song
    initialization. This was proposed by some users in the early development
    stage of SIDPLAY/DOS. In <em>PlaySID compatibility mode</em> SIDPLAY behaves like 
    PlaySID and uses only the Accumulator and clears X- and Y-Register.
    Sub-routines should correctly initialize all the registers and addresses
    they use.

Since</a> I wanted the term SID to be part of the player's name 
there were't been too many alternative names:
Dr.SID, SID-it!, (just) SID, SID Player (this is what the program itself is, but not a name :),
PlaySID? (no, different emulation, a different program, a different name), SIDemu, SID2PC,
