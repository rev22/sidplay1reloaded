+                                  ABOUT STIL
+                                  ==========
+
+  The SID Tune Information List (STIL) contains information about the SID
+tunes in the HVSC besides the standard TITLE, AUTHOR, and COPYRIGHT
+information.  STIL goes a little deeper listing SID tune information that
+only a true SID freak would enjoy.  Such information listed in STIL would
+include cover information, interesting facts, useless trivia, etc.  STIL
+will be limited to factual data and will not try to provide an encyclopedia
+about every original artist.
+
+  Regardless of a cover or remix, proper credit needs to be given to the
+original composer.  For simplicity, we will intend "cover" to be equal to
+"remix".
+
+Why was STIL created?
+---------------------
+
+  The High Voltage SID Collection (HVSC) crew sincerely believes in
+creating the most accurate and comprehensive SID collection possible.  We
+also believe in giving proper credit to all composers regardless if they
+ever composed on the Commodore 64.  How many times have you asked
+yourself, "Where have I heard this tune before?!"  STIL will help ease
+some of those questions.  STIL will also be extremely valuable for the
+future of SID music collections.  Imagine years ahead when the HVSC
+maintainers are no longer available for input for whatever reasons.
+Wouldn't it be a shame if someone began to alter the credit fields of the
+tunes in HVSC based on incorrect data?  And finally, perhaps someday a new
+SID tune file format will emerge allowing relevant SID tune information to
+be available when the tune is played?  If so, STIL will be there to fill
+in the blanks.
+
+We need Your help!
+------------------
+
+  If we have missed any information about the tunes in HVSC, please email
+<lala@interaccess.com>.  If you are able to list information about 10 or more
+SID tunes in HVSC, you will become a STIL HERO.  This information would
+include any corrections, additions, and filling in any blanks.  All STIL HEROs
+will have their name appended to the end of this file.  It is _unlikely_ that
+you will become a STIL HERO since we have already listed many of the covers
+and other such SID information. (*NOTE* the previous sentence was my attempt
+at some basic psychology... Will it work?)
+
+
+                                THE FORMAT OF STIL
+                                ==================
+
+  If you do decide to email us STIL data, please adhere to our standard so
+that we can effortlessly paste your data into our list. It is also important
+to stick to the strict STIL format as the STIL is checked by programs, and
+also, some versions of SIDPlay now show STIL entries when playing SID tunes.
+Since all of these programs do strict format-checking, PLEASE, follow the
+outlined standard of STIL entries if you ever decide to send us new entries!
+Thank You!
+
+Here is a brief summary of the format of STIL entries:
+
+
+---- SINGLE TUNES -----
+
+/Path_in_HVSC/Full_Title.sid #y X:XX
+  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune>
+ ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
+COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>
+
+
+----- TUNES WITH MULTIPLE COVERS IN ONE MUSIC -----
+
+(Notice how there might be TWO entries required in this case for the same SID!)
+
+/Path_in_HVSC/Full_Title.sid                     <--- This is the entry that
+  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune> (#x)                is optional of the two!
+ ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
+COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>
+... etc.
+
+/Path_in_HVSC/Full_Title.sid #y
+  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune> (X:XX)
+ ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
+COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>
+  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune> (X:XX)
+ ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
+COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>
+... etc.
+
+
+----- FILES WITH MULTIPLE TUNES, ALL BEING COVERS -----
+
+/Path_in_HVSC/Full_Title.sid
+  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune> (#y)
+ ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
+COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>
+  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune> (#y)
+ ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
+COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>
+... etc.
+
+
+----- FILES THAT COVER ANOTHER C64 MUSIC'S SUBTUNE -----
+
+(Note the subtle difference from above!!!)
+
+/Path_in_HVSC/Full_Title.sid
+  TITLE: <Title of Original C64 Tune>, Tune #y
+ ARTIST: <Original Composer of the C64 Tune>
+
+(This means that name.sid covers the y-th subtune of the given C64 tune.)
+
+
+NOTES:
+-----
+
+Path_in_HVSC - starting with a "/", subdirs separated by "/", long pathnames
+               (with correct small and capital letters)
+Full_Title.sid - The long filename as appears in the directory
+#y           - Tune #y within the file
+X:XX         - The time the given cover starts at (based on SIDPLAY
+               timestamps!)
+
+- Please note that there are TWO spaces before "TITLE", ONE space before
+  "ARTIST", and NO space before "COMMENT". This just makes STIL more readable.
+
+- All fields are optional, except the path and the tune name, but at least one
+  field must be present. Eg. if only a comment is provided for a tune that has
+  no subtunes, the following entry is perfectly fine:
+
+  /Composer/Tune.sid
+  COMMENT: This should be some relevant comment here.
+
+- The COMMENT field has no restriction on length. Try to keep the other
+  fields within one line ( < 80 chars), if possible.
+
+- The "#y" field is required for files containing multiple subtunes. "X:XX" is
+  optional, and if omitted, assumed to be 0:00.
+
+- Please, place a "<?>" behind (or in place of) every information that is
+  doubtful or missing!
+
+- If a cover covers another C64 tune that is also a cover itself, please
+  still submit the very *ORIGINAL* tune for the STIL entry! You may provide a
+  comment, though, that states that the given cover is really a cover of
+  another cover. (Phiew, did you follow that? ;)
+
+- If you submit more than one STIL entry, PLEASE, list the tunes in
+  alphabetical order, sorted on the pathnames.
+
+If still in doubt, consult the STIL itself for examples.
+
+Thank You!
+We hope you find STIL useful!

+[27] Did you know that my virus checker reports some SIDs as having viruses?
+[28] When will HVSC be completed?
+[29] I find myself listening to SID music all the time.  Am I normal?
+
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+[1] What is the High Voltage SID Collection (HVSC)?
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+HVSC is the ultimate SID tune collection featuring at least 99% of the
+most requested SIDs from the Commodore 64.  The collection includes SIDs
+(aka C64 music) from games, demos, intros, etc.  HVSC has been in the
+making for nearly 2 years and is the result of many contributors.  
+
+[2] What software and hardware do I need to play the tunes in HVSC?
+-------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Lucky for you, there are many devoted SID fans throughout the world.  Many
+people have created or ported SID emulators to various OSes.  To name a
+few: Win95, Win3.1, Linux, MSDOS, MacOS, AmigaOS, Atari Falcon, BeOS,
+OS/2, etc.  For a complete list of which OSs are supported, see the HVSC web
+page.  You can also listen to the SIDs in HVSC on a real C64 with Real SID
+Play.  More information is available on the HVSC web page.
+
+As for additional hardware, you only need a sound card.  That's it!
+
+[3] So then, do I need to hook up a SID chip to my PC?  Or what?
+----------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Listen to me!  You only need a SID emulator program, some SID tunes, and a
+sound card!  It's that easy.
+
+[4] Isn't Commodore C64 music just silly beep-blop music?
+---------------------------------------------------------
+
+Absolutely not!  Although the C64 went into production in 1983, do not
+underestimate the C64's technology.  In fact, Byte Magazine named the C64's
+Sound Interface Device (SID) as one of the 20 most important chips in
+computer history along side the PowerPC, Intel 8086, and Pentium.  After all,
+there has to be a reason why there are so many SID fans.  I should note that
+there were two distinctive regions for SID music, America and Europe.
+American SID music is on average lower in quality compared to European SID
+music.  This is not to say that American SID music is crap, but if you are
+judging SID music based on the American SID music you have heard, I can
+understand partially why you might think SID music is silly.  Why is American
+SID music lacking compared to European SID music?  Mainly this has to do with
+much information sharing related to the SID composing tools in Europe (not to
+mention some theft as well).  The best way for you to determine if SID music
+is or isn't for you is to listen to some of the best.  Take a listen to some
+Hubbard, Galway, Daglish, and Tel.  If you do not like any of those artists,
+then there is a strong chance you will not like any SID music.
+
+[5] Why should I get HVSC when I already have NemeSIDs?
+-------------------------------------------------------
+
+NemeSIDs is the only other legitimate, large-scale SID collection available
+on the Internet.  Primarily created for PLAYSID (Amiga) users, NemeSIDs was
+a great collection in its time.  HVSC, on the other hand, was built off
+of all the collections available on the Internet, plus we added over 4000
+SIDs from various people.  This means that HVSC has all of the tunes found
+in NemeSIDs, except for NemeSIDs 18-19 (Compute Gazette SIDPlayer SIDs).
+Further, we have spent many months adding 100% rips, fixing SID credits,
+and deleting repeated SIDs.  NemeSIDs, formerly maintained by Nemesis1, has
+not received an update since June 1996.  In addition, NemeSIDs required the
+user to manually update the collection.  With HVSC, updates are automated.
+If you doubt what we say, then please, by all means, go download HVSC and
+compare it to NemeSIDs yourself.  We are confident that if you do such, you
+will end up keeping HVSC.
+
+[6] Why aren't there any Compute Gazette SIDPlayer tunes in HVSC?
+-----------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Mainly, because on average they do not sound as good as non-SIDPlayer tunes.
+SIDPlayer was a public domain SID composer and player available in the early
+'80s on the C64.  The tool was predominately used by Americans and has a
+strong following among the public domain audience.  SIDPlayer tunes are
+usually follow by a ".mus" and can be found on some C64 ftp sites.
+
+(note: do not confuse SIDPlayer with SIDPlay.  SIDPlay is a SID emulator
+where as SIDPlayer is a SID player for the C64.  Confusion is easy when there
+is SIDPlay, PLAYSID (Amiga), SIDPlayer (C64), Real SIDPlay (C64), etc.)
+
+[7] What is the SID Tune Information List (STIL)?
+-------------------------------------------------
+
+The STIL is basically a text file which contains general information about
+the SIDs in HVSC.  Such information includes the original composer's name,
+defects in certain tunes, interesting trivia, etc.  Consult the STIL FAQ
+for more information.  Hopefully your SID emulator has the option to
+display the STIL information for the current playing SID tune.
+
+[8] Why doesn't HVSC support MSDOS's 8.3 filename convention?
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+
+We have racked our brains trying to figure out an easy solution to support
+short filename OSes.  Every solution we came up with required much work
+from our end.  Since the maintainers of HVSC organize the collection as
+a hobby, we cannot spend a great amount of time catering to such a small
+audience.  We have concluded that support for short filename based OSes
+will have to come from a devoted user of such an OSes.  Keep in mind that
+the long filenames do not prevent 8.3 OSes from playing the music files.
+Only the Update tool won't work and the filenames will likely be cluttered
+with those nasty tildes (~).
+
+[9] When will the next update be released?
+------------------------------------------
+
+There is no fixed time schedule as to when each update is released.  Each
+update is dependent on two factors: available time and available SIDs.  Once
+enough SIDs have been sent in to equal around 1.44 MBs (compressed) and the
+HVSC crew has time enough to properly sort the SIDs, the next update will
+be released.  At present, it takes on average two months to put together a
+new update.
+
+[10] Do I have to download all of HVSC after each update?
+---------------------------------------------------------
+
+No.  The update comes with a tool that automatically updates HVSC to the
+next version.  Instructions are provided in each update and within the
+tool.
+
+[11] Why isn't the update tool available for my system?
+-------------------------------------------------------
+
+The update tool was made in mind to be portable.  The code at present
+could use some cleaning up, but one does not have to port the code to his
+system.  One could instead code the program from scratch.  The update tool
+is only available for Win95, AmigaOS, OS/2, and Unix systems.  Plans are
+underway to port the tool to other OSes, but we have no timetable as to
+when these will be completed (if ever).  If you would like the source code
+to the tool and information about the format of the HVS data file, email
+<shark@dhp.com>.
+
+[12] Why do the updates sometimes add SIDs that HVSC already had?
+-----------------------------------------------------------------
+
+We often replace SIDs in HVSC with better versions.  Reason for replacing
+SIDs could be (1) more sub-tunes (2) 100% rip (3) significantly smaller
+(4) merger of several SIDs.  A "100% rip" would include fixed tunes,
+Real SID Play compatible tunes, Full Bank Switching tunes, etc.  Thus,
+there is a chance that a new version of a tune could sound identical to
+the current version in HVSC.  The new rip, however, has some internal
+changes that does in fact make it superior.  Note that occasionally we do
+mistakenly add repeated tunes.
+
+[13] After I ran the Update, I can no longer find some SIDs.
+     Where did they go?
+------------------------------------------------------------
+
+To find out more details as to where SIDs were moved, why they were
+deleted, why they were replaced, etc., view the /DOCUMENTS/UpdateXX.hvs
+file for the current update.  The "XX" in the path mentioned in the
+previous sentence represents the current update number.  So if after
+running Update #7 you can no longer find a favorite SID, check
+/DOCUMENTS/Update07.hvs and search the file for the location where that
+SID was manipulated.  The UpdateXX.hvs file serves as a data file for the
+UPDATE tool but is also readable by humanoids and does contain some
+comments.  The best way to find the section of the file that contains the
+information you seek is to do a string search on the old SID or the path
+where the SID resided.
+
+[14] How can I tell what version of HVSC I have?
+------------------------------------------------
+
+Look at /DOCUMENTS/hv_sids.txt.  The first few lines will tell you what
+version you have.
+
+[15] Why should I get HVSC when I can just load up the game/demo and hear
+     the music on a real C64?
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+You likely fall in the category "I don't need no stinkin' emulator!"
+First off, remember that HVSC isn't just for emulator users.  In fact,
+the tunes in HVSC are still in raw C64 code only prepended by some header
+information.  To handle this, a tool on the C64 called "Real SID Play"
+(RSP) is available to play HVSC tunes on the C64.  It plays approximately
+96% of the tunes in HVSC.  Of the tunes that do not play in RSP, they
+could be bad rips, tunes that have overlapping memory with RSP, or tunes
+that have samples.  Tunes with samples require some non-C64-compatible
+modifications in order to be playable in some SID emulators.  Another
+reason C64 user may enjoyr HVSC is that it is the largest SID collection
+on Earth.  It is unlikely that you have all of the programs from where the
+SIDs in HVSC originated.  Plus, with HVSC, you can select any level tune at
+any time.  As a final note, it is true that the SID emulators do not sound
+as splendid as a real SID.  To quote Zardax, "With SID emulators, the soul
+of the SID is lost."  Of course Zardax has only heard PlaySID which does
+not emulate SID filters.  Nevertheless, his statement is partially true.
+SID emulators, however, are getting better all the time.  And for people
+who no longer own a C64, SID emulators are a _dream_.
+
+[16] Why do some tunes sound different compared to how I remember them on
+     the C64?
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+SID emulators are very good, but not perfect.  Although SID emulation is
+not perfect, the actual rip of the SID tune may be corrupt.  There is also
+the chance that your memory is not 100% accurate.  If you believe you
+have found a corrupt tune, it would be best if you load up the old tune on
+a C64/128 and compare it to the HVSC version.  If you then notice a problem
+with the HVSC version, by all means, let us know.  We strongly recommend
+that you do not compare the HVSC tune to a tune played in a C64 emulator.
+Most C64 emulators which emulate the SID are no where as good as the pure
+SID emulators.  You might also want to check out the STIL which documents
+any known problems with the SIDs found in HVSC.
+
+[17] How do I rip SID tunes from games/demos?
+---------------------------------------------
+
+Consult http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/
+
+Also, SIDPlay comes with technical information about converting SIDs to
+PSID format.  The conversion process is surprisingly easy.
+
+[18] Why isn't tune X in HVSC?
+------------------------------
+
+Of course, not every SID ever made on the C64 is in HVSC.  We feel that
+99% of the most requested tunes are in HVSC.  This does not mean we feel
+that 99% of _all_ C64 tunes are in HVSC.  The HVSC crew is always busy
+ripping new SIDs and always receiving more SIDs.  In fact, the crew is
+extremely back logged with SIDs to rip.  The best thing you can do if you
+would like to hear a certain tune in HVSC is to check out the HVSC Request
+web page which can be reached from the main HVSC web site.
+
+[19] I can't find tune Y in HVSC which was used in an old intro/demo.
+     Can you tell me where it is?
+---------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Haha!  Unfortunately, many intro coders and programmers failed to properly
+give credit to the music they used in their work.  HVSC, thankfully, is very
+accurate in the credits it gives.  We have worked for months contacting the
+original composers of tunes to help verify SID credits in HVSC.  I don't
+think you are going to like what I am leading up to.  C64 musicians have
+long been ignored on the C64.  Many people will say, "Do you have the music
+to Commando?" not knowing who made the music.  The time has come that you
+too should learn these composers' names.  Basically, what I am telling you
+is that there is a chance that you will have to roll up your sleeves and dig
+through HVSC searching for your old favorite tunes.  Before you do this,
+though, you should check out the HVSC search engine at the HVSC web site.
+With just a fragment of information, you can perhaps find the tune.  Also,
+note that the professional composers (i.e., ones who received money for their
+work) are at the root of HVSC.  Some of the lesser known composers and
+composers from post-1992 are in the "VARIOUS" directory.  Knowing this
+information should help reduce your search time.
+
+[20] Why do some of the tunes in HVSC not play?
+-----------------------------------------------
+
+More than likely, a silent tune is a PSID-only tune or the tune doesn't
+bank-switch properly.  Assuming you are using SIDPlay, you can change the
+settings and play the tune in PSID environment as well as Transparent ROM
+mode.  Our goal it to replace all these tunes with versions that will work
+in Full Bank-Switching mode.
+
+[21] Why are there some incorrect or ugly-looking credits in HVSC?
+------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Slowly but surely we are taking care of this.  With each update, we make
+at least 200 credit fixes.  So please be patient and if you notice any
+incorrect credits, email us and we'll try to fix them for the next update.
+
+[22] Why does HVSC take up so much space on my hard drive?
+----------------------------------------------------------
+
+This is the infamous cluster problem predominately found on Microsoft OSs.
+Basically, due to a lack of foresight on Microsoft's end, the cluster size
+for hard drives grows larger as the hard drives grow larger.  (In fact, if
+the hard drive gets large enough, you actually have to partition it.)  This
+is a problem since any data written of size less than a cluster size
+consumes at least the size of a cluster.  For example, if you were to
+create a one byte file, that file would take up at least the size of one
+cluster on the hard drive.  Common cluster sizes are 16 & 32 KBs.  Perhaps
+now you see the problem?  Many SIDs are around 4 KBs which is 4-8 times
+less than the most common cluster sizes.  This problem affects many people
+besides HVSC users.  The good news is that Microsoft plans to use a new
+file system for their approaching OS, Win98, which will fix this.  Further,
+newer PCs are sold with a revised version of Win95 which includes
+Microsoft's Fat32 file system.
+
+If the size of HVSC is a problem for you, there are some space-saving
+ways to store HVSC.  One method is to keep the collection zipped.  If your
+uncompressing tool has the capability, you can double click the SID of your
+choice while in the uncompressing tool and the SID will play.  This assumes
+that you have associated ".sid" files with a SID emulator.  If you decide
+to keep HVSC zipped, you may want to create one large zip file instead of
+having many.
+
+Another popular technique is to use DriveSpace, which is an included tool
+with Win95.  DriveSpace allows you to compress partial or entire hard
+drives, but treats the compressed drive like a normal drive.  Using
+DriveSpace should reduce the amount of space consumed by HVSC by at least
+half.  Further, we have noticed no slow down when playing SIDs that reside
+on a compressed drive.  Consult the on-line DriveSpace help for more
+information.
+
+[23] Can I just download the individual tunes I want?
+-----------------------------------------------------
+
+Yes.  HVSC is available unzipped at a few web and ftp sites.  A listing of
+these sites can be found at the HVSC web page.
+
+[24] How is it determined which composers go under the /VARIOUS dir?
+--------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The current rule is:
+
+ (1) If the artist has no tunes made in 1992 or earlier, go to step #4
+ (2) If the artist has game tunes made in 1992 or earlier, above Various
+     else go to step #3
+ (3) If the artist was a famous demo composer in 1992 or earlier, above
+     Various...else go to step #4
+ (4) Below Various
+
+[25] Do you offer HVSC on CD?
+-----------------------------
+
+Plans are being made to offer HVSC on CD.  No profit will be made on the CD
+and HVSC will still be freely available on the Internet.  The people who
+plan to burn the CD are not part of the HVSC crew.  We will, however,
+assist them as best as we can.  Further, we will only recommend CDs that
+we feel are a fair deal.
+
+[26] Is the High Voltage SID Collection related to the High Voltage CDs?
+------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+No.  They are two separate collections.  HVSC specializes in SID music where
+as HV CDs specialize in C64 games, demos, and music all in emulator format.
+Due to an early agreement between HVSC and HV CDs, HVSC uses the same name
+as HV CDs.  HV CD #1 contains a partial NemeSIDs collection where HV CD #2
+contains HVSC 1.1.  HVSC has changed much since the HV CDs were put together.
+Therefore, we strongly recommend that you get the newest version HVSC from
+our web site.
+
+[27] Did you know that my virus checker reports some SIDs as having viruses?
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Let me guess.  You are using Norton Anti-Virus (NAV)?  Apparently Norton
+Anti-Virus's method for searching for viruses seems to be somewhat abnormal
+or inefficient compared to other virus checkers.  No other virus checker that
+we know of has flagged any SIDs in HVSC as having a virus besides NAV.  More
+than likely, you should consider NAV's warning a false indication of a virus.
+Even if NAV was correct about a virus being present in a SID, the virus would
+be harmless since the SIDs are not an executable or macro.  Infected data
+files, however, can be an indication that your system does have a virus
+lurking somewhere.
+
+[28] When will HVSC be completed?
+---------------------------------
+
+In all likelihood, never.  Far too many tunes were made on the C64 to
+reasonably expect that every SID will be collected.  In addition, people
+are still composing music on the C64 to this day.  Consider HVSC a living
+collection.
+
+[29] I find myself listening to SID music all the time.  Am I normal?
+---------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+No, you are a SID-aholic.  But we consider this a good thing.  ;)
