Hi people!

Here's an official but unreleased patch (diff and zip attached). Feel
free to use it if you think it is necessary. This will be safe as I'll
not release a different patchlevel 33 of course.

One reason why I don't publish this patch yet is that it is completely
related to Compute!'s Sidplayer, and I don't have the slightest idea if
any SIDPLAY/Linux users listen to Sidplayer musics actually. In case
Peter Weighill's large Sidplayer music collection gets somewhat popular
I expect users to bug me about any songs that don't work in 1.36.32.
;-)  Yes, my attitude towards *.MUS files has not changed. I still think
all those MUS songs lack artistic quality compared to the average
non-Sidplayer sidtune.

Here's the home page of Compute!'s Sidplayer author Craig Chamberlain:
  http://www-personal.umich.edu/~craigch/sidplayer/

Another reason is the new Linux kernel 2.2 which no longer causes the
dirty CTRL+C key combination to exit the player immediately as with the
2.0 kernel (at least on my machine). Most likely I'll have to find a
work-around to fix the command line demo player.

Mike

P.S.: This is not a mailing-list. There will not be many announcements
like this. Your address has been added because a) you have asked me to
do so, or b) you are the author of a front-end to SIDPLAY, or c) I think
you might be interested, or d) I've been informed that you've packaged
SIDPLAY. If you don't want to receive further messages (if any), please
get back to me, and sorry for any confusion.
