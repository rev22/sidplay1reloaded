<P>
Setting this switch is done by enabling <B>NTSC Clock Speed</B> plus <B>
Force Song Speed</B>.
<P>
Beware - this setting doesn't make much sense <A NAME="tex2html2" HREF="footnode.html#135"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="./foot_motif.gif"></A>, but needs a bit more explanation. This setting forces SIDPLAY
to pitch up a little bit and replay any sidtune with NTSC timing, regardless of whether the file
is set up to play at any other intended speed except variable timer speed.
If you just want the sound of an NTSC C64 (that is the slightly
different pitch), enable NTSC Clock Speed and disable the Force Song Speed option.
<P>
In NTSC Song Speed mode SIDPLAY calls the music replaying routine at 60 Hz like a vertical
blanking interrupt (VBI) of a NTSC based machine would do. But explicitly forcing this speed
is not necessary and is most likely the wrong speed for a song, because all sidtunes already
contain specific information about their original and intended replaying speed. This information
is supposed to be correct for any existing sidtune that has been set up properly even if the
corresponding C64 program has been PAL-NTSC fixed or vice versa. Thus, if a game and its music
have been designed for a NTSC based machine, the extracted music generally has been set up by
someone to play at 60 Hz by default. You can verify this by taking a look at the speed information
display or by examining the sidtune file contents. Musics which are called via timer interrupts
are intended to run at variable timer speed and have not been affected by PAL-NTSC conversion
anyway. The difference between the PAL and NTSC CIA timer speed is equal to the clock speed
difference, that is a factor of 1.038 only.
<P>
Due to the fact that PAL based screens (TV, monitor, ...) generally are able to display more
lines of pixels than NTSC based ones, the NTSC screen refresh rate (60 Hz) is 1.2 times faster than
the PAL (50 Hz) rate. Therefore, on NTSC based machines a VBI driven music routine is called more
often, thus leading to falsification of the originally intended music timing. Such programs
require a socalled PAL-NTSC conversion which makes them run at intended speed on another system
with different clock speed.
<P>
Unfortunately, a lot of European games haven't been PAL-NTSC fixed. And as the musics have often
been played via VBI, they have been played too fast on NTSC based machines. Thus it seems, as if
former users of NTSC based machines now think that a lot of tunes are played too slow in comparison
to what they were used to on their old C64 computer <A NAME="tex2html3" HREF="footnode.html#418"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="./foot_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
If you don't care whether a tune is playing at its originally intended and correct replaying speed,
and you are used to listen to tunes that are played too fast, enabling NTSC Clock Speed as well as
Force Song Speed is a cure. But please believe the fact that any sidtune is supposed to run at proper
speed <em>without</em> explicitly enabling the NTSC mode. If you are sure the default speed of a sidtune
is wrong, please contact the maintainer of the respective sidtune collection.
