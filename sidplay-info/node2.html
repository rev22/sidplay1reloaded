<H1><A NAME="SECTION00200000000000000000">1 Introduction</A></H1>
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00210000000000000000">1.1 What is SIDPLAY</A></H1>
<P>
Basically, SIDPLAY is just an ordinary music player software. More specifically, SIDPLAY
emulates the <B>Sound Interface Device</B> chip (MOS 6581, commonly called <B>SID</B>)
and the Micro Processor Unit (MOS 6510) of the Commodore 64 on your computer. It is a
platform independent software emulating these hardware components. Therefore it is able
to load and execute C64 machine code programs which produce music or sound. In general
these are independent fragments of code and data which have been ripped from games and
demonstration programs and have been transferred directly from the C64. All you need is
a supported operating system and audio hardware with average PCM waveform playback
capabilities. A fast CPU and a 16-bit sound card are recommended for better performance
and quality.
<P>
SID emulation has its roots in the Amiga programs <B>The 100 most remembered C64
game-tunes</B> and <B>PlaySID</B> by Per H&#229;kan Sundell and Ron Birk.
<P>
SIDPLAY itself is <em>not</em> based on any portions of sourcecode for PlaySID.
It has been developed and programmed from scratch. As a result and also influenced
by the different hardware that has been used during development, its SID emulator
architecture differs significantly from PlaySID.
<P>
After PlaySID, SIDPLAY was the second publically available SID music player
world-wide and the first one on multiple operating systems.
<P>
SIDPLAY is <em>not</em> related to the music editing and playing programs on the C64, called
<B>Sidplayer</B> by Craig Chamberlain and <B>Stereo Sidplayer</B> by Mark Dickenson. In
the early days of the SIDPLAY project I was not aware of the existence of those C64 programs.
I didn't want to start any confusion by choosing a similar name<A NAME="tex2html1" HREF="footnode.html#26"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="./foot_motif.gif"></A>.
Nevertheless, minor support for Sidplayer .MUS files is implemented, too.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00220000000000000000">1.2 Disclaimer</A></H1>
<P>
Unlike some available C64 emulators SIDPLAY does not claim it would emulate the original
SID chip perfectly, neither the MOS-6581 revisions nor the later MOS-8580 revisions.
Better do not replay at frequencies much higher than 48 kHz.
<P>
The analogue output of the SID hardware is extremely complex and partially irregular.
This makes it almost impossible for an emulator author to develop software that calculates
equivalent output. Additionally, the output of each individual SID chip
varies not just slightly due to tolerances in its electronical components, such as capacitors
for instance. To give you an impression of the extent of a possible difference between two
SID chips, it is possible that you are hardly able to notice a low-pass filter
effect on one chip whereas the same filter effect sounds way too strong on
another chip.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00230000000000000000">1.3 The term sidtune</A></H1>
<P>
Apparently, the European part of the world refers to any piece of Commodore 64 music - where
the SID chip is used to produce sound - as <B>sidtune</B>, while some of the American part
of the world only denote music, which is made with the C64 programs <em>Sidplayer</em>
or <em>Stereo Sidplayer</em>, sidtunes or just <B>sids</B>.
<P>
In any SIDPLAY related document the term sidtune applies to any kind of SID music. This is an
obvious decision, because almost all the music in well-known C64 games and demos was not made
with either the two applications mentioned above, but each song is commonly called a sidtune.
Especially it is not distinguished between ready-to-play files and music player machine code
(and data) in a C64 program.
<P>
When a song is just playing through the SID chip this is called a sidtune, too. For instance,
you can hear someone saying ``I'm listening to the Commando sidtune'' instead of
``I'm listening to Rob Hubbard's music from Commando''.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00240000000000000000">1.4 Sidtunes for SIDPLAY and compatibles</A></H1>
<P>
More than 7700 different sidtunes from Commodore 64 games and demos are available on the Internet.
A lot even contain several sub-songs. These musics are still copyrighted by their original creators
or by the company who owned the rights in the first release.
<P>
A lot of the sidtunes are 10 years old. Some are even older, some are not a month old. Hence,
spreading them together with the original credits is more likely to act as advertising than
causing any consequential damage. Additionally, the maintainers of recent sidtune collections
are in contact with a lot of (famous) C64 music composers and get invaluable support upon
verifying the song credits and ownerships.
<P>
See section <A HREF="node3.html#sidcollection">2.4</A> on where to get SID music.
