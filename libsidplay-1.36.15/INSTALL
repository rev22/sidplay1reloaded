CONFIGURATION:

By default, this directory is set up for an i386-compatible Linux system.
Simply run ``make'' to compile a static library. Please be extremely
careful with the compiler optimization settings in the Makefile. Depending
on the version of your compiler these might produce malfunctioning code.

To build a shared library type ``make libsidplay.so ; make install''.


OTHER PLATFORMS:

Check ``include/compconf.h'' for items to configure. Most workstations
contain big endian hardware. Make sure you enable IS_BIG_ENDIAN. Edit the
Makefile to reflect compiler settings which are working on your system.
