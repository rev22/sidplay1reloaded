                                  ABOUT STIL
                                  ==========

  The SID Tune Information List (STIL) contains information about the SID
tunes in the HVSC besides the standard TITLE, AUTHOR, and COPYRIGHT
information.  STIL goes a little deeper listing SID tune information that
only a true SID freak would enjoy.  Such information listed in STIL would
include cover information, interesting facts, useless trivia, etc.  STIL
will be limited to factual data and will not try to provide an encyclopedia
about every original artist.

Now some definitions (unofficial):

  cover - a tune not originally composed by the current creating composer.
          (also known as a rearranged tune)

  remix - a tune where a composer has made some changes to a previously
          released tune.

Regardless of a cover or remix, proper credit needs to be given to the
original composer.  For simplicity, we will intend "cover" to be equal to
"remix".

Why was STIL created?

  The High Voltage SID Collection (HVSC) crew sincerely believes in
creating the most accurate and comprehensive SID collection possible.  We
also believe in giving proper credit to all composers regardless if they
ever composed on the Commodore 64.  How many times have you asked
yourself, "Where have I heard this tune before?!"  STIL will help ease
some of those questions.  STIL will also be extremely valuable for the
future of SID music collections.  Imagine years ahead when the HVSC
maintainers are no longer available for input for whatever reasons.
Wouldn't it be a shame if someone began to alter the credit fields of the
tunes in HVSC based on incorrect data?  And finally, perhaps someday a new
SID tune file format will emerge allowing relevant SID tune information to
be available when the tune is played?  If so, STIL will be there to fill
in the blanks.

  We need your help!  If we have missed any information about the tunes in
HVSC, please email <lala@interaccess.com>.  If you are able to list
information about 10 or more SID tunes in HVSC, you will become a STIL
HERO.  This information would include any corrections, additions, and
filling in any blanks.  All STIL HEROs will have their name appended to
the end of this file.  It is _unlikely_ that you will become a STIL HERO
since we have already listed many of the covers and other such SID
information. (*NOTE* the previous sentence was my attempt at some basic
psychology... Will it work?)

  If you do decide to email us STIL data, please adhere to our standard so
that we can effortlessly paste your data into our list. It is also important 
to stick to the strict STIL format as the STIL is checked by programs, and 
also, some versions of SIDPlay now show STIL entries when playing SID tunes. 
Since all of these programs do strict format-checking, please follow the 
outlined standard of STIL entries.

Here is a brief summary of the format of STIL entries:


SINGLE TUNES:

/Path_in_HVSC/Full_Title.sid #y X:XX
  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune>
 ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>


TUNES WITH MULTIPLE COVERS IN ONE MUSIC:

/Path_in_HVSC/Full_Title.sid #y
  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune> (X:XX)
 ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>
  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune> (X:XX)
 ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>
... etc.


FILES WITH MULTIPLE TUNES, ALL BEING COVERS:

/Path_in_HVSC/Full_Title.sid
  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune> (#y)
 ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>
  TITLE: <Title of Original Tune> (#y)
 ARTIST: <Original Performing Artist>
COMMENT: <Comment on tune - facts only, no personal opinions!>
... etc.


FILES THAT COVER ANOTHER C64 MUSIC'S SUBTUNE
(Note the subtle difference from above!!!)

/Path_in_HVSC/Full_Title.sid
  TITLE: <Title of Original C64 Tune>, Tune #y
 ARTIST: <Original Composer of the C64 Tune>

(This means that name.sid covers the y-th subtune of the given C64 tune.)

NOTES:
-----

Path_in_HVSC - starting with a "/", subdirs separated by "/", long pathnames
               (with correct small and capital letters)
Full_Title.sid - The long filename as appears in the directory               
#y           - Tune #y within the file
X:XX         - The time the given cover starts at (based on SIDPLAY 
               timestamps!)

- Please note that there are TWO spaces before "TITLE", ONE space before
  "ARTIST", and NO space before "COMMENT". This just makes STIL more readable.

- All fields are optional, except the path and the tune name, but at least one
  field must be present. Eg. if only a comment is provided for a tune that has 
  no subtunes, the following entry is perfectly fine:

  /Composer/Tune.sid
  COMMENT: This should be some relevant comment here.

- The COMMENT field has no restriction on length. Try to keep the other
  fields within one line ( < 80 chars), if possible.

- The "#y" field is required for files containing multiple subtunes. "X:XX" is
  optional, and if omitted, assumed to be 0:00.

- Please, place a "<?>" behind (or in place of) every information that is
  doubtful or missing!

- If a cover covers another C64 tune that is also a cover itself, please 
  still submit the very *ORIGINAL* tune for the STIL entry! You may provide a 
  comment, though, that states that the given cover is really a cover of   
  another cover. (Phiew, did you follow that? ;)
  
- If you submit more than one STIL entry, PLEASE, list the tunes in 
  alphabetical order, sorted on the pathnames.

If still in doubt, consult the STIL itself for examples.

Thank You!
We hope you find STIL useful!
